Our component libraries are also developed and learned by referring to existing component libraries. view has the meaning of observation and is a homophone with vue, so we combine h and view together. We named the library hview-ui to indicate that this new library will learn the advantages of integrating the existing library, hoping to present you with a good library project.</p><br><h2 id="project-logo" tabindex="-1">Project Logo <a class="header-anchor" href="#project-logo" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p><a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/33905ebd43fab53ba7ddf546e5a34e5618d61beca3bed4c440c9bf01c9712339/68747470733a2f2f6f73732e7a686973686979752e6f6e6c696e652f6d61726b646f776e5f696d616765732f3230323330313139313930383839362e706e67" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/33905ebd43fab53ba7ddf546e5a34e5618d61beca3bed4c440c9bf01c9712339/68747470733a2f2f6f73732e7a686973686979752e6f6e6c696e652f6d61726b646f776e5f696d616765732f3230323330313139313930383839362e706e67" alt="img"></a></p><h3 id="idea" tabindex="-1">Idea <a class="header-anchor" href="#idea" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>view also means perspective and view.

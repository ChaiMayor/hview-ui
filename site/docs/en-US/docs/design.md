## Project Name

Hview-UI

Implied meaning：Often the first code to learn programming is hello world, and it is the first time for us to develop component libraries. Our component libraries are also developed and learned by referring to existing component libraries, and view has the meaning of observation, perspective, view, etc., so we combine h and view together, and give the component library its name: hview-ui, meaning that our new component library by learning the advantages of integrating existing component libraries, hope to present you with a good component library project.

Design：View has the meaning of perspective and view. Here, three patterns in different view directions are used to form the H.

Implied meaning：There are still many imperfections in our component library. We sincerely hope that the majority of developers can use our component library and give us feedback and questions. We will humbly accept and then accept your opinions, and continue to iterate the project that satisfies the developers.

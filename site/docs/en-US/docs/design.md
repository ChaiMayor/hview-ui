## Project Name

Hview-UI

Implied meaning：Usually, the first code to learn programming is Hello World, and it is the first time for us to develop component libraries. Our component libraries are also developed and learned by referring to existing component libraries. view has the meaning of observation and is a homophone with vue, so we combine h and view together. We named the library hview-ui to indicate that this new library will learn the advantages of integrating the existing library, hoping to present you with a good library project.

Design：view also means perspective and view. Here, three patterns in different view directions are used to form the H to make it a three-dimensional and multi-faceted effect.

Implied meaning：There are still many imperfections in our component library. We sincerely hope that the majority of developers can use our component library and give us feedback and questions. We will humbly accept and then accept your opinions, and continue to iterate the project that satisfies the developers.
